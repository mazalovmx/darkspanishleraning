# Project state

Updated: 2026-10-05
Branch: implementation
Current task: Epic 2 fog and POIs completed, with existing shutdown diagnostics.
Next task: authored dialogue (sequence step 05 / Epic 4) to complete Gate B.

## Provenance

Upstream repository: https://github.com/gdquest-demos/godot-open-rpg
Upstream commit: 19bd328fae9e4b534d3bb6db380a3d871d6ea58f
Engine verified: 4.6.2.stable.official.71f334935
Working project: game/project.godot; main scene: game/src/world/world_map.tscn.
The upstream/ checkout is an ignored local reference, not an embedded submodule.
Original root specifications and docs/ copies match byte-for-byte.

## Retained and removed

Retained turn-based combat, field/grid movement, inventory, UI, Dialogic, camera,
transitions and their required assets. See ARCHITECTURE.md for paths.
No demo story assets removed: main.tscn directly references town/forest dialogue,
quest interactions and battle scenes. Deletion is deferred until a replacement main
scene isolates these dependencies. No investigation gameplay has been added.

## Bootstrap changes

Added missing working docs, initial config and tracked directory scaffolding.
Patched Dialogic's portrait container: runtime debug settings are read only outside
editor mode. Previously editor import raised a Nil/PortraitContainers script error.
No speculative refactoring or changes to scenario/specification content.

## Checks actually run

- Engine version: correct 4.6.2 build.
- Editor import: exit 0; no script/import errors after the portrait fix.
- Headless main scene, 180 frames: exit 0; no startup script errors.
- Windowed main scene, 180 frames: exit 0; OpenGL Compatibility initialized on
  AMD Radeon Vega 8; no startup script errors. Window launched hidden.
- Root/docs specification hashes match.

## Known issues and unverified behavior

Editor shutdown reports ObjectDB instances leaked. Both timed runtime runs report
ObjectDB instances leaked and `26 resources still in use at exit`. These are unresolved
shutdown diagnostics, not a clean all-errors-free result. They did not prevent startup.
Original demo dialogue/combat, performance targets and export have not been tested.
Claude API, learner model, canonical GameState, evidence and JSON save/load are not
implemented. Initial config is not yet loaded by runtime code.

## Gates

Bootstrap startup accepted with the documented nonfatal shutdown limitations.
Gate A: passed for the prototype movement loop. Gates B through I: not passed.
Epic 2 is complete. Gate B remains pending until authored dialogue works.

## Epic 1: minimal world map

- Authored 20 x 20 JSON terrain rendered with TileMapLayer, a Sprite2D hero and Camera2D.
- Weighted AStarGrid2D routes, cardinal movement, blocked water/mountains, all specified
  terrain costs. Out-of-bounds/unreachable/over-budget moves leave state unchanged.
- Click hero to select; hover previews a route and total cost; click destination moves.
  Right click deselects; middle drag pans; wheel zooms. Spanish UI shows day and points.
- End turn advances the single-hero day and restores 18 movement points.
- RefCounted WorldState owns prototype data; visuals reflect it. A full campaign
  GameState/autoload, HeroState, saves and multi-hero rules remain future work.
- New runtime code/content/tests live in game/ so Godot resource paths work without
  copying or external-path dependencies. Root scaffolding remains reserved.

Validation: 58 checks passed headless and with OpenGL on Radeon Vega 8, exit 0.
Coverage includes weighted detours, blocked and unreachable cells, full budget use,
atomic rejection, selection/movement via viewport mouse events, pan/zoom picking,
route preview and end-turn signal wiring. New default main scene ran for 60 frames.
Imported scripts successfully; inspected a rendered 1280 x 720 screenshot with route,
hero selection and readable controls. Existing shutdown leak diagnostics persist.
No manual human playtest or FPS benchmark is claimed.

Limitations: placeholder colored tiles, instant movement (no animation), single hero,
whole-route affordability required (no partial movement). Fog and POIs were added in Epic 2 below.

## Epic 2: fog and POIs

- WorldState owns UNKNOWN/EXPLORED/VISIBLE fog with a circular radius of 5 cells,
  without line-of-sight simulation. Each traversed cell reveals its surroundings;
  only the final hero radius remains visible. Exploration persists through turns.
- Unknown terrain is absent from TileMapLayer and painted opaque; explored terrain
  is dimmed. Player previews and moves use a separate AStarGrid2D containing only
  discovered traversable cells, so unknown routes and terrain costs cannot leak.
  The original full-terrain grid remains available for rule-level regression tests.
- JSON contains LOC11 Venta del Perro Negro and LOC01 Santa Lucerna with canonical
  names/IDs from the scenario bible. Positions [6,11] and [12,10] are prototype-only,
  not replacements for full-map coordinates or the campaign's monastery start.
- Discovered POIs show markers. Arrival opens a shared Spanish description window;
  revisiting the current cell reopens it without spending points. Close button and
  Escape restore controls. Modal blocks movement, camera input and end turn.
- No dialogue, purchases, clues, NPCs or quest transitions have been implemented.

Validation: 365 assertions passed headless and with OpenGL (exit 0), including the
existing movement regression suite, circular visibility, intermediate route reveal,
exploration retention, exclusion of every unknown cell from player navigation,
failed POI movement, actual close-button mouse input, Escape, reopening and modal
input isolation. Rendered map and monastery-window screenshots inspected at 1280x720.
Editor import also completed with exit 0 and no script/import errors.
The known ObjectDB/26-resources shutdown diagnostics persist. Manual playtesting and
FPS benchmarking remain unperformed. Gate B is not marked passed.
